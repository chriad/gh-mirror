 - Software from github that I'd like to install on my machine but is not accessible through apt/flatpack/snap package managers and must be installed manually (e.g. compiled)
 - Software that must be cutting-edge and is outdated on package managers
 - Software that comes with documentation that I need freequently but is not installed as manpage (e.g. youtube-dl)
 - all repos must be added as submodules
 - sync across machines and install
 - This should only contain software that needs to be installed. Put other github projects that are of interest and worth tracking into gh-playground


How can I reproduce a system configuration?

Install packages by ...

- pip
- node (e.g. json)
- gem (e.g. lolcommits)
  etc.
