 - Software from github that I'd like to install on my machine but is not accessible through apt/flatpack/snap package managers and must be installed manually (e.g. compiled)
 - Software that must be cutting-edge and is outdated on package managers
 - Software that comes with documentation that I need freequently but is not installed as manpage (e.g. youtube-dl)
 - all repos must be added as submodules
 - sync across machines and install
 - This should only contain software that needs to be installed. Put other github projects that are of interest and worth tracking into gh-playground


How can I reproduce a system configuration?

Install packages by ...

- pip
- node (e.g. json)
- gem (e.g. lolcommits)
  etc.

  To checkout first time:

  #+begin_src bash
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:chriad/gh-mirror.git
  #+end_src

  1. On workstation:
     git submodule add ...
     git push

  2. On folio:
     git pull
     git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs 5

     reason := {documentation, outdated}
     method := {snap, apt, manual, flatpak, anaconda, pip}
     
| repo    | method   | reason        |
|---------+----------+---------------|
| chezmoi | snap     | documentation |
| up      | manual   |               |
| ytcc    | anaconda | documentation |
    

move submodule

git mv bla/x bli/x
